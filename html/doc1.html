If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one. Tip my hat to the sun in the west. Feel the beat right in my chest. At the crossroads a second time. Make the devil change his mind. Its a pound of flesh but its really a ton. 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one. If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one. 99 problems. But a bitch ain’t one. Like broken glass under my feet. I can lose my mind in the sea. Looking for prize but I don’t blood. All I wanna drink is drink the flood. You can come inside but your friends can’t come. 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one. If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one. I got 99. 99. 99. 99. 99 problems. But a bitch ain’t one. 99. 99 problems and a bitch ain’t one.
